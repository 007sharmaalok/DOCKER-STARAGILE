Container Orchestration Tool - Kubernetes 
===========================================
Difference between DockerSwarm and Kubernetes.
Architecture of Kubernetes 
Install kubernetes on Ubuntu 22


Agenda:
 
What are Pods 
Create a pod using a YAMl file 
Create an Ubuntu pod using a YAMl file 
Create a service to access the Pods 
Create a node port service to access the pods 

In order to write the code in kubernetes we have to use YAML file 

In order to just create a single pod we have to write a YAMl file

This YAML consist of 4 sections :

kind:  What is the object that we have to create . The object name is always given by kubernetes
apiVersion: A schema or library that K8s will use to create the POD. This is always given by kubernetes
metadata: Give name or labels and details about the pod
  name = give name of the object 
  labels:
  these are keys and values 
  they are used to give a unique tag to the pod 
  You can use labels to query pods in the cluster 
spec: specify what should pod do


# kubectl create -f pod-defintion.yml
 To fetch all the pods from the cluster 
# kubectl get pods 

To delete the pods from the cluster 
# kubectl delete pod pod1 pod2

Demo 2:
================
In a pod you can create multiple containers and it is called as multi container Pod 

If you have a requirement when :

2 containers from 2 different images have to always coexist 

Otherwise we always prefer 1 pod - 1 container 

Can we have 1 pod (mysql + app container)

If pod is deleted --> your entire app will be down 


Instead if I create 1 pod of DB and 1 POD of webapp 

What could be the use case of multi container POD :
=================================
When 2 containers have a depndency of collection of logs, one container need to read data form another container 
then they can co exist .

I want to see what are the container running in my Pod

kubectl describe pod multi-cont | less

Demo: How can we access the application that is deployed on the Pod 

In docker we used port mapping concept in order to access the app of your container form your browser 

-p 8989:80

In kubernetes same port mapping concept is implemented using the object Service 

Service of type : ClusterIP
===============================

Problem :

With In kubernetes can 2 pods communicate with each other ? yes they can using the pod ip address 

Step 1: Create a pod of image httpd 

pod1   1/1     Running   0          32s   192.168.107.49   instance-20241019-025649   <none>           <none>

Step 2: Create a pod of image ubuntu 

test-pod   1/1     Running   0          10s     192.168.107.54   instance-20241019-025649   <none>           <none>


Step 3: loginto ubuntu pod , install curl/ping/wget 

 kubectl exec -it test-pod -- bash
 
Step 4: from ubuntu send a request to httpd  pod 
curl 192.168.107.49
<html><body><h1>It works!</h1></body></html>

The prolblem: 

If 2 pods are communicating via their ip address but if any one pod get deleted upon recreate the pod Ip changes

then we will ahve to manually go to the testing pod and changes the pod 1 ip address 

2 pods cannot communicate via the names

Solution:

You go and create service of type Cluster IP in which
kubernetes will give you a service which has a name and an Ipaddress 

Now using the service ip address one pod can send req to the endpoint 

Step 1:Check if you have any endpoints 

kubectl get endpoints

Step 2: Create the service 

service/mysvc        ClusterIP   10.101.56.235   <none>        80/TCP    5s
